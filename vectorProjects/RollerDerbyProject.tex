\begin{multicols}{2}\noindent We are going to race 4 objects down a ramp. Suppose you roll a marble (solid ball), a squash ball (hollow ball), streel bar (solid cylinder), and a lead pipe (hollow cylinder) down a ramp at the same time.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a guess about which object will reach the bottom first.


\item To answer definitely we consider a ball and cylinder with mass $m$, radius $r$, moment of inertia $I$ (about the axis of rotation). If the highest place on the ramp is $h$, then what is the potential energy of the object?


\item If the object reaches the bottom with velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\omega$ (with $v = r\omega$)  then what is the kinetic energy at the bottom of the ramp? (Hint: Remember that kinentic energy consists of translational and rotational energy.)

\item If the energy lost by friction is negligible then conservation of energy gives:


\item Show that $\displaystyle v^2 = \frac{2gh}{1+I^*}$ where $\displaystyle I^* = \frac{I}{mr^2}$.

\item Let $y(t)$ be the vertical distance traveled at time $t$. Show that $\displaystyle v^2 = \frac{2gy(t)}{1+I^*}$ at any time $t$.

\item Show that $y$ satisfies the differential equation:

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = \sqrt{\frac{2g}{1+I^*}}(\sin \alpha ) \sqrt{y}$$

where $\alpha$ is the angle of inclination of the ramp.

\item Solve the differential equation above and use it to find the total travel time $T$.


\item Since $h, g, \alpha$ are constants what must be true about $I^*$ to minimize the total travel time $T$ and hence win the race?


\item Find $I^*$ for a solid cylinder.

\item Find $I^*$ for a hollow cylinder.

\item Find $I^*$ for a solid sphere. 

\item Find $I^*$ for a hollow sphere.

\item Conclude the finishing order of the race.
